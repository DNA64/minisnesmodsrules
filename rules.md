# Rules & Community Guidelines

In an effort to keep our community a safe and pleasant place open to civilized discussions, we've expanded upon our previous, limited set of rules. We ask that everyone follow the rules below at all times or risk being removed from the community either temporarily, or permanently! (At the discretion of the moderators).

 ## No Piracy!
 We have a Zero Tolerance Policy towards piracy! 
 No linking to, asking for, or about, or discussion or mention of ROM-sharing websites, or other copyright-infringing websites or content. This also includes linking to the miniNES and miniSNES firmware, kernels or any firmware or BIOS that is protected by copyrights. **First offense receives a permanent lifetime ban**.

**Exceptions:** 
- You can link users looking for the [Firmware or Kernels](https://wiki.hakchi.net/Boot_Image) to the wiki for more information.

**Example of posts/comments that WILL get you banned:**

- > Does anyone know where I can download roms?

- > Can someone help me find the Sony PlayStation SCPH-1001 bios?

- > Can someone send me or link me to the SNES EU Firmware?

- > I found it on the ********** rom site.

**Example of posts/comments that will NOT get you banned:**

- > Where do I place the PlayStation BIOS?

- > I added the ROM using Hakchi2 CE, but it doesn't load, can someone help?

- > Does anyone know where I can find an English patch for this ROM?

- > Google your thoughts :P "Sony PlayStation SCPH-1001 bios"

## Be respectful.

No bad attitudes, and no being a dick. ([Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) is a good guideline to follow.)
This is a friendly, inclusive, and fun community. Debate and disagreement are okay, but behavior like these aren't tolerated:

-   prejudice (including homophobia, sexism, racism, or slurs);
-   personal attacks, insults, harassment, "witch hunting" or threats;
-   trolling, spamming;
-   flaming (Give criticism of the post, not the poster)
-   swearing at other users;
-   rape/suicide jokes;
-   posting private communications without permission (Such as discord conversations);
-   reposting someone else's work without permission or a link to the original (or credit if no link available);
-   similar behavior at mod discretion.

## No NSFW content.

That includes anything pornographic, sexually explicit, or blatantly suggestive. Light sexual innuendo is okay in the right context.

## Questions answered in the FAQ/Sidebar

-   Use the search bar, your search engine, and the  [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/miniSNESmods/wiki/faq)  to ensure that you are not re-posting recent content or already answered questions. Duplicate questions are subject to locking and removal.

## Keep postings relevant to the SNES Classic

-   This is a community by SNES Classic fans for SNES Classic fans. Let's keep the content here limited to related topics, and not videos of your cat chasing a laser pointer. If you have another classic system you would like to discuss or need help with, we suggest joining one of the Related Subreddits in the sidebar like [r/ClassicMods](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicMods).

## All content should be in English.

That includes, posts, comments and linked content. Links to non-English content is okay if it's subtitled, translated or otherwise interesting to English speakers (Subject to the mod teams discretion).

## No referral or URL shortener links.

This includes amazon referral links or any other link in which you profit or benefit from. Any links found in violation of this rule will result in the users account being banned.

## Self promotion
### Limits on promoting streams and let's play videos.

- No more than two self-promotions a week in the comments areas (no posts).
Self-promotions should be thoughtful, limited, and consistently well received by the community. 
You can link to streams and let's play videos in comments (not posts - See exceptions below), subject to  [Reddit's self-promotion guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

- Be a Redditor with a website, not a website with a Reddit account.

- _Affiliate_ links on [r/miniSNESmods](https://www.reddit.com/r/miniSNESmods) are not allowed and will lead to your content being removed and possibly a ban.


**Exceptions:**

-   Linking to streams for non-promotional reasons (e.g. for tutorials related to mods &/or modding, or to demo upcoming mods or releases), including in posts.

- Approved YouTubers who have consistently been well received by the community, posting quality, related content, as well as developers working on various scene related projects maybe exempt from certain self promotion limits.

## No low-effort posts.

Posts should spark discussion relevant to the community and not duplicate recent threads. Use the search function, and If you're not sure, post it and we'll moderate if needed.

If the title/description are a valid discussion topic by themselves, any images contained aren't subject to this rule.

**These are OK:**

-   asking for help (Use the search function first!);
-   sharing screenshots of errors;
-   posting photos of your mods in action

**These may be removed:**

-   Questions answered in the FAQs.
- Links to Youtube videos not relevant to the modding community

**Attention!**
These Rules & Community Guidelines are subject to change without notice at anytime, please take a moment to check them before posting or commenting if you're unsure if your post/comment will violate them.
